                  Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain,
                  that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a
                  kind of machine perception, labeling or clustering raw input. The patterns they
                  recognize are numerical, contained in vectors, into which all real-world data, be
                  it images, sound, text or time series, must be translated.
                </MKTypography>
                <MKTypography variant="body2" color="text" mt={2}>
                  What makes neural networks so powerful is their ability to learn from data,
                  improving their accuracy over time without being explicitly programmed with rules.
                  This capability has led to breakthroughs in image and speech recognition, natural
                  language processing, and game playing, among many other domains.
